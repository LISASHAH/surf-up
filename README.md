<br>Analysis:
<br>1.The average temperature in June comes as 75 degree while the average for December shows as 71 degree. So there is around 4 degrees of temperature difference.
<br>2.The minimum temperature in June is 64 degree and in Dec is 56. So with the difference of 9 degrees there could be some impact on surfing during month of Dec
<br>3.But the difference in maximum temeperature is not very big and hence the afternoons may be equally warm.
<br>4.Though average percipitation is almost the same. THe maximum is 2 points more during the month of Dec then in June.
<br>
<br>
<br>Recomendation for future analysis:
<br>1.There are other factors like wind,volcano etc that can impact the inflow of surfers. So those should be analyzed.
<br>2.We should check the frequency of max percipitation in Jun to make sure the impact days are not as many.
<br>3.We can also analyze data per station to find the best station to put icecream shop.
<br>4.We can analyze yearly data to get more details around the impact for the weather if any.
